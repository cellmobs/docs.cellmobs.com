# Your App Organization

In the Cellmobs platform, each Tenant App is associated with a primary default Organization. This default Organization serves as the foundation for configuring the main settings of an app, ensuring that it operates according to the desired requirements.

When a new app is created, a new blank database is automatically generated for that app. This database includes the default app configuration, which can be customized to meet the specific needs of the app. Alongside the default app configuration, a sysadmin account is also created within the primary default Organization.

The sysadmin account is provisioned with the credentials of the primary Cellmobs customer account, granting the account holder full administrative access to the app and its associated settings. This enables the account holder to manage and modify the app configuration, user roles, permissions, and other essential aspects of the app as needed.

By utilizing a primary default Organization and sysadmin account, the Cellmobs platform simplifies the initial setup process and ensures a consistent and secure foundation for every Tenant App. This approach allows for a seamless transition from app creation to customization and ongoing management, providing a reliable and user-friendly experience for app developers and administrators.
