# Nuxt SDK

Coming soon!
<!-- Cellmobs provides a Nuxt SDK that allows us to easily build a UI for our site. -->

<!-- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) is a free and open source JavaScript library based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js. Nuxt is inspired by Next.js, which is a framework of similar purpose, based on React.js.

## Cloning the project
Before we get started, we need to fulfill the following dependencies

- Git
- Node Js
- A suitable code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
- Access to Bitbucket

Once done, open a terminal and enter the following command
> **_NOTE:_**  We currently don't have a dedicated nuxt base project, so the URL below needs to be updated.
```bash
git clone https://<USER>@bitbucket.org/cellmobs/cellmobs-nuxt.git
cd cellmobs-nuxt
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies
``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.vue`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Testing

There is currently an issue with axios accepting unsigned SSL certificates which makes local API connection difficult.
One option is to add the self-signed certificated of the local API host to your certificate store as described here:

## Adding new pages
One of Nuxt.js's best features is its support for a file-system-based router. This means that to create a new page, we
can do it in two ways:

1. Create a new folder with the name of the route in the pages directory
    - Create an index.vue file and add the Vue page component.
2. Create a new `<page-name>.vue` files in the pages folder.

Reference the new page in your existing pages using the [NuxtLink](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/nuxt-components#the-nuxtlink-component) component.

## Deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Nuxt.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/#get-started).

Check out the [Nuxt.js deployment documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/get-started/commands) for more details.
