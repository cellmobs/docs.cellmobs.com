## Create a database
Cellmobs provides a fully managed database solution through MongoDB Atlas. Databases are replicated across multiple regions and backed up continously. They can be scaled on demand and according to your subscription tier.

- Navigate to the "Database" section to get details of the database or to bring in your own database (for Premium users only)
- We can also view the database stats in this section.

To request a personal login to your database, please contact support and open a support ticket. Personal logins will allow you to use popular MongoDB client tools like MongoDB Compass or Studio3T. Personal database login credentials are only available to paid subscriptions.

## Invite your Team

We can invite members from your team to manage your application through the "Team" Section.
