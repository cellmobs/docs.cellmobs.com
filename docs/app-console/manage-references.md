# References

The Reference entity in Cellmobs plays a important role in establishing flexible and customizable relationships between various entities within your application. Essentially, a Reference entity acts as a bridge, linking together two or more different entities based on a user-defined `ReferenceType`.

A reference type can be anything you define, allowing you to create connections that make sense for your specific application's needs. For example, you might have a 'user to product' reference that links a User entity to a Product entity, showing that a particular user has purchased a certain product. Similarly, you might create an 'order to product' reference that associates an Order entity with the specific Product entities it includes.

These reference entities and types provide a powerful tool for shaping your data relationships in a way that's most meaningful for your application. They can represent real-world associations or dependencies that exist between different pieces of data, making your application more intuitive and your data easier to manage and understand.

Here are a few benefits of using Reference entities:

- **Versatility**: You're not limited to predefined relationships. You can create any type of connection that suits your application's needs.

- **Enhanced Data Insight**: By establishing connections between entities, you can create a more comprehensive view of your data and gain deeper insights.

- **Increased Efficiency**: Instead of manually linking data or writing complex code to establish connections, you can use Reference entities to easily create and manage relationships.

- **Simplified Data Management**: By using references, you can avoid data duplication and ensure a single source of truth for your data.
