# Ledgers

Ledgers in Cellmobs function as a comprehensive financial log that captures all the monetary transactions within an application. This includes capturing [payment transactions](/app-console/manage-orders/#payment-transactions) related to [product](/app-console/manage-products) orders from certain vendors, an attribute associated with Organizations that participate in a Cellmobs [Marketplace](/guide/marketplaces) or [E-Commerce](/guide/e-commerce) application.

Ledgers can also document the revenue and cost elements related to order servicing and collaborations with business partners. While the use of Ledgers is optional, having an [Organization](/app-console/manage-organizations) entity configured with a primary Ledger simplifies financial tracking. Once this configuration is set, all the monetary data tied to that Organization will automatically flow into the designated Ledger.

This ability to track financial flows effectively becomes particularly significant for financial analyses and reports. By having a complete record of revenues, costs in the Ledger, it becomes easier to generate meaningful financial insights and reports. For example the sytem can generate profit sharing reports between provided that the terms of any agreements between the involved Organizations (such as Vendors, Customers, Suppliers) have been properly logged as [Deals](/app-console/manage-ledgers#Deals).

Ledgers in Cellmobs offer a high degree of flexibility, allowing users to not only track internal financial transactions but also to import entries from external sources. Users can add data to ledgers through CSV imports, making it easier to centralize financial information from various sources in a single location. This can be particularly useful when dealing with multiple channels or platforms where financial transactions occur. Or with revenue statements received by business partners. 

Additionally, ledgers can be updated with financial data received via [API integrations](/app-console/manage-integrations) from other applications and integrations. This seamless connection between systems ensures that your financial records around cost and revenues related to Products are centralized and always up-to-date, minimizing the potential for discrepancies or missing data.

Moreover, the information captured in these ledgers can also be synchronized with popular accounting software like Intuit's Quicken and QuickBooks (Coming soon). This will enable a streamlined workflow, allowing businesses to seamlessly move financial data between their operational platform and their accounting system.
