# Manage Data

Cellmobs provides data synchronization and transformation capabilities for several of its core entity types through API Integrations. This allows developers to seamlessly move or copy data like Content (Files), Identities (Users or Contacts), Organizations, and Products from one application to another.

Here's a brief overview of how this works for each entity type:

1. **Content (Files)**: Cellmobs allows you to copy or move files from one application to another. This can be useful for cases where you want to share or reuse assets across different applications. The synchronization process ensures that the file's metadata is also transferred, ensuring consistency and integrity across applications.

2. **Identities (Users or Contacts)**: You can synchronize user or contact data across different applications. This can be extremely useful for businesses that have multiple applications and want to provide a unified user experience. For example, if a user updates customer information in one application, this change can be automatically reflected in all other applications.

3. **Organizations**: Cellmobs provides the capability to copy or move organization data across applications. This can be useful for businesses that operate multiple applications and want to maintain a consistent organization structure across all of them.

4. **Products**: Cellmobs allows you to synchronize product data across different applications. This can be particularly useful for businesses that sell the same products across different platforms or channels. By synchronizing product data, businesses can ensure that product information is always up-to-date and consistent across all platforms.
