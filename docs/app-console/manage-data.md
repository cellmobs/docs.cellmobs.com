# Manage Data

Cellmobs provides data synchronization and transformation capabilities for several of its core entity types through API Integrations. This allows developers to seamlessly move or copy data like Content (Files), Identities (Users or Contacts), Organizations, and Products from one application to another.

Here's a brief overview of how this works for each entity type:

1. **Content (Files)**: Cellmobs allows you to copy or move files from one application to another. This can be useful for cases where you want to share or reuse assets across different applications. The synchronization process ensures that the file's metadata is also transferred, ensuring consistency and integrity across applications.

2. **Identities (Users or Contacts)**: You can synchronize user or contact data across different applications. This can be extremely useful for businesses that have multiple applications and want to provide a unified user experience. For example, if a user updates customer information in one application, this change can be automatically reflected in all other applications.

3. **Organizations**: Cellmobs provides the capability to copy or move organization data across applications. This can be useful for businesses that operate multiple applications and want to maintain a consistent organization structure across all of them.

4. **Products**: Cellmobs allows you to synchronize product data across different applications. This can be particularly useful for businesses that sell the same products across different platforms or channels. By synchronizing product data, businesses can ensure that product information is always up-to-date and consistent across all platforms.

## Unified Data Model

Cellmobs provider a unified data model that acts as a common language for your applications. This framework not only simplifies development but also ensures consistency across different applications or services you might be using or creating.

A unified data model offers a standardized structure where all your application's data can be described and organized in a uniform manner. It means that various types of data like [user](/app-console/manage-users) information, [products](/app-console/manage-products), [orders](/app-console/manage-orders), transactions, and others are stored and interacted with consistently, irrespective of their source or the application handling them.

This uniformity plays a vital role in facilitating seamless interactions between different components of an application, or even separate applications within your ecosystem. For example, a unified data model would allow an e-commerce app, a customer support app, and a marketing app to all understand and utilize the same customer data. 

The benefits of such an approach are numerous: 

- **Simplified Data Management**: A unified model offers a consistent and simplified way to manage and interact with data. It eliminates the need for complex translations or conversions between different data formats or structures.

- **Improved Interoperability**: When all applications use the same data model, they can seamlessly exchange and make use of information, improving the interoperability between different systems.

- **Increased Efficiency**: By using a standardized model, developers can reduce the time and effort needed to integrate new systems or data sources into the application.

- **Enhanced Data Quality and Consistency**: With a unified approach, the risk of data inconsistency or redundancy is significantly reduced, leading to improved data quality.
