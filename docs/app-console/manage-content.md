# Content

Content is a central entity in the Cellmobs platform, representing all file-based data, such as images, documents, and videos. It plays a crucial role in many aspects of the platform and can be associated with various Cellmobs entities, including [Products](/app-console/manage-products), DealsTerms, Feeds, Channels, and more.

Developers have the flexibility to use Cellmobs to host their static content or connect their Cellmobs App to their own AWS S3 account or other cloud storage locations such as Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, or OneDrive. This versatility allows developers to choose the storage solution that best fits their requirements and preferences.

Content in Cellmobs is always associated with a primary [Organization](/app-console/manage-organizations). This association determines which users have access to read and modify the content, ensuring that content management is securely controlled within the platform.
